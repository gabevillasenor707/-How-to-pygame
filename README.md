# How-to-pygame
This is the code for how to use pygame that i followed along on Tech with Tim's channel on YouTube.
This was done in pycharm and you will need to install pygame and pythong 3 to use it.
Each file will have small chnages and be updates for the previous one but i wanted to sparate them so you can take it at your own pace and read through however you want. Also all this is avalibe to follow along on Tech with Tim's channel.
